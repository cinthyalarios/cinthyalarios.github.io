      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>I live with my mom in Selma. With us, live my three brothers: Omar, Alan, Brian. We own one dog, his name is Chewy. That is everyone from my family.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>School</h2>
      <p>Because I live in Selma, I obviously attend Selma High School. Selma High is one of the worst schools ever, but I still manage to perform pretty good, my grades are good and yeah.</p>
   </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I really don't like to do anything other than stay home, but when I do, it is either Upward Bound, go to the movies with my friends, or play soccer at Selma High.</p>
